****NFL ANALYSIS****

**Introduction to Problem:**
We can present an opportunity to predict certain aspects of “Special Teams” of NFL games with the dataset which we will be working on. We can break down the data of kickoffs, field goals, and punts. With this project we should be able to discover how a team performs in “Special Teams” in field goal attempts, punts, and kickoffs. Our target population would consist of those with an interest in football, football coaches as they can use the data to determine when they should or shouldn’t punt or attempt a field goal, and place kickers that play football so they can use the data to gain a competitive advantage by improving their weaknesses or overall position weaknesses to set themselves apart from other place kickers or improve their skill set. For the purposes of this project, we plan on using predictive analysis to predict the outcome of a field goal, the outcome/type of kickoff, and punting tendencies. 

**Research Question:**
How does a ‘Special Team’ perform in the NFL playoffs, considering the data from the year 2018-2020.

It will help us to predict and analyse:
Special teams analysis
To predict the outcomes of field goal attempts based on ball placement, snap time, operation time, etc.
Predict the outcome and what type  of a kickoff based on what type of kick formation was given, score of the game, and time left on the clock.
Predict punting tendencies based off past data of punters(direction of punt, hang time of punt, yard line the team punted on)


**Data Resource:**
[NFL Big Data Bowl 2022] (www.kaggle.com/c/nfl-big-data-bowl-2022)


**Future Work:**
Following are the list of topics which if given an opportunity in future we might able to work on:
Player gameplay post their injuries
Heat map of players movement
Heat map of environmental factors such as type of field (i.e. grass or turf), weather conditions, temperature, etc.
Histogram of missed/made kicks based on distance
Physical trait monitoring (heartbeat, oxygen level)
