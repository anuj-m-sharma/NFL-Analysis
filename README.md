****NFL ANALYSIS****

**Introduction to Problem:**
For our project, we want to try to predict what a NFL running backs fantasy football production will be based on their statistics from previous years. Fantasy football is an extremely popular game where people can own virtual teams with NFL players in a privately owned or public league with other real people that also pick their teams. We wanted to predict what a running backs production would be specifically because running backs are the most valuable players in fantasy football leagues and consistently provide the most points for fantasy football owners. We will be taking their fantasy football production statistics and try to predict what their future fantasy production will be based on previous seasons. 

**Research Question:**
What will this fantasy football NFL running back's point average per game be considering the data from the year 2018-2020?

It will help us to predict and analyse:

**Future Work:**
Following are the list of topics which if given an opportunity in future we might able to work on:
NFL running backs previous fantasy football season production
Heat map of rushing yards, receiving yards, etc. in relation to fantasy points
Pairplot to see where there is a stronger relationship for some variables such as rushing yards, touchdowns, etc. as opposed to others
